        Imagine a playful, energetic Boxer bringing joy to your family! Roxy, a 3-year-old sweetheart, is wonderful with children and has a loving nature that shines through once she gets comfortable.

      <img src="./images/Sebastian1.jpg" style="width: 600px;;height:auto;"/>
      <p>
        This is Sebastian, an orange tabby that is 5 years old. Unfortunately, his former owner developed allergies that couldn't be solved with medication, so Sebastian had to be given up for adoption. 
        He loves playing with cat toys and sleeping on high objects such as refrigerators and window sills. He gets along with various animals including dogs and small animals. 
        Sebastian has been spayed and vaccinated every year and loves going to the vet.

        Ready for a loving companion? Cookie, a healthy and happy 3-year-old poodle, is fully vaccinated and house-trained! 
        At 15 pounds, she's the perfect size for cuddles and play. Cookie is a fantastic listener and gets along well with other dogs.

        We found him stranded on the road after a large storm. He is very shy and takes a while to open up to people but, once he does, he is essentially glued to your side. He loves lickable treats and temptations treats to the point of attempting to open the container if it is left out so beware. If you believe Mr Purrkins is the companion for you, contact us to find out about adding him to your family.</p>

While he's still learning how to socialize with other dogs, his willingness to learn makes him a perfect candidate for a loving and patient owner.

    <strong>🐾Midnight</strong>
    
    <img src="./images/Midnight1.jpg" style="width: 600px;;height:auto;"/>
