       <h4>🐾 Luna’s Story</h4>
       <blockquote class="quote">
        “We adopted Luna three months ago, and she has completely transformed our lives. When she first arrived, 
        she was timid and spent most of her time hiding under the couch. But with patience, love, and lots of belly rubs, she slowly started to trust us. 
        Now she follows us everywhere, wags her tail nonstop, and even sleeps curled up next to us every night. 
        Adopting her was one of the best decisions we have ever made.”

      <h4>🐾 Oliver’s New Life</h4>
       <blockquote class="quote">
        “Oliver came into our home like a little ball of curiosity and chaos, and we wouldn’t have it any other way. 
        From the moment we met him at the adoption center, he stole our hearts. 
        Our kids absolutely adore him, and he has become a constant source of laughter and comfort in our household. 
        He watches TV with us, climbs into laundry baskets, and waits by the door when the kids come home from school. He’s not just a pet

      <h4>🐾 Benny’s Forever Home</h4>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        “I was hesitant to adopt at first because I had never had a pet before, but the team made the process so easy and welcoming. 
        When I met Benny, I knew we were meant to be. He has such a bright personality — always smiling, always wagging his tail. 
        Every morning, he wakes me up with kisses and excitement for our daily walks. 
        He’s helped me build a routine, feel more connected, and find joy in the little things. I can’t imagine life without him now.”
