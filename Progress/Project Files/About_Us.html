    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p><strong>Furry Friends Rescue</strong> is a compassionate nonprofit organization dedicated to rescuing, 
      rehabilitating, and housing abandoned and homeless animals that includes cats, dogs, and other small animals.
      Since our founding in 2025, we've matched hundreds of pets with loving families across the Chicagoland area.
    </p>
    <p>At Furry friends Rescue, we believe that no animal should be without a loving home. With that in mind, our team
      works tirelessly to provide care, medical attention, and emotional support that each pet needs before being 
      adopted into a new forever home.

      <h3>Our Founders</h3>
      <div class="founder">
         <strong>Charles Smith</strong> is a lifetime animal lover of all species. Growing up in the south side of Chicago,
       Charles, who goes by Chuck, has always had a love of animals. He would sneak out at night to feed the stray
       animals in the neighbordhood much to his mom's chagrin. Charles co-founded Furry Friends Rescue with his friends
       Michael and Moises to create a safe haven for animals in need.

      <div class="founder" >
       <strong>Moises Aguirre</strong> has loved animals for as long as he can remember. Growing up in El Salvador, 
       he was always the kid who couldn’t walk past a stray dog without trying to feed it or pet it. His family has 
       rescued several cats and dogs over the years, and seeing how their personalities changed once they felt safe
       and loved really stuck with him. That’s a big part of why he cares so much about animal rescue. He believes every
       animal deserves a second chance ,  not just shelter, but a real home. Working on this project with his friends 
       Chuck and Michael feels meaningful because it’s one more way he can help make that happen.

      <div class="founder" >  
      <strong>Michael Jackson</strong> From a young age, sharing his life with two dogs instilled in him a deep passion for all pets. 
      This connection was beautifully reinforced in 2021 when he adopted his third dog. The companionship pets offer 
      has always touched his heart. Knowing the number of animals in shelters waiting for a home, he is a strong 
      advocate for animal adoption, as he believes every animal deserves the security and love of a permanent family. With his friends
      and allies Chuck and Moises, he co-founded Furry Friends Rescue to help find homes for hundreds of pets
