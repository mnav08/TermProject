        Imagine a playful, energetic Boxer bringing joy to your family! Roxy, a 3-year-old sweetheart, is wonderful with children and has a loving nature that shines through once she gets comfortable.

      <p><strong>Sebastian, Tabby</strong></p>
      <p>
        This is Sebastian, an orange tabby that is 5 years old. Unfortunately, his former owner developed allergies that couldn't be solved with medication, so Sebastian had to be given up for adoption. 
        He loves playing with cat toys and sleeping on high objects such as refrigerators and window sills. He gets along with various animals including dogs and small animals. 
        Sebastian has been spayed and vaccinated every year and loves going to the vet.
