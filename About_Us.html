    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p><strong>Furry Friends Rescue</strong> is a compassionate nonprofit organization dedicated to rescuing, 
      rehabilitating, and housing abandoned and homeless animals that includes cats, dogs, and other small animals.
      Since our founding in 2025, we've matched hundreds of pets with loving families across the Chicagoland area.
    </p>
    <p>Our mission is rooted in the belief that every animal deserves a safe, caring, and permanent home. We provide 
	   not only shelter but also essential medical care, emotional support, and individualized attention to every animal 
	   that comes through our doors. Our team works tirelessly, day and night, to ensure that no animal is left behind—whether 
	   it's rescuing a stray off the streets, taking in animals from overcrowded shelters, or helping families rehome pets in times 
	   of hardship.
    </p>
    <p>We partner with local veterinarians, volunteers, and foster families to create a strong support system for the animals in our care. 
	   Through community outreach and education, we aim to raise awareness about responsible pet ownership, spaying and neutering, and the 
	   importance of adoption.

            <strong>Charles Smith</strong> is a lifetime animal lover of all species. Growing up in the south side of Chicago,
            Charles, who goes by Chuck, has always had a love of animals. He would sneak out at night to feed the stray
            animals in the neighbordhood much to his mom's chagrin. Currently, Charles has 2 companions of his own. One cat and one dog who are both rescues 
            that were found stranded and given homes. Charles co-founded Furry Friends Rescue with his friends Michael and Moises to 
            create a safe haven for animals in need.

           <strong>Moises Aguirre</strong> has loved animals for as long as he can remember. Growing up in El Salvador, 
           he was always the kid who couldn’t walk past a stray dog without trying to feed it or pet it. His family has 
           rescued several cats and dogs over the years, and seeing how their personalities changed once they felt safe
           and loved really stuck with him. That’s a big part of why he cares so much about animal rescue. He believes every
           animal deserves a second chance ,  not just shelter, but a real home. Working on this project with his friends 
           Chuck and Michael feels meaningful because it’s one more way he can help make that happen.

           <strong>Matthew Jackson</strong> From a young age, sharing his life with two dogs instilled in him a deep passion for all pets. 
           This connection was beautifully reinforced in 2021 when he adopted his third dog. The companionship pets offer 
           has always touched his heart. Knowing the number of animals in shelters waiting for a home, he is a strong 
           advocate for animal adoption, as he believes every animal deserves the security and love of a permanent family. With his friends
           and allies Chuck and Moises, he co-founded Furry Friends Rescue to help find homes for hundreds of pets
